# Project-3 - Covid-19 Tracker

## Description:

This is a covid-19 tracking application that shows how the coronavirus has affected specific states and allows you to search for news articles involving coronavirus that were published in the last month. This is valuable because it allows people to keep track of the most dangerous places that have high levels of coronavirus and learn about how to stay safe from it.

## User Story:

As a concerned member of society in this time of a pandemic, I want to find information about Covid-19 that will help to educate me and potentially keep me safe.
